# RunHidden

A simple program which hides its console window immediately after start and then runs the specified command. It also enables you to do some tricks like redirecting stdout to file inside Windows Task Scheduler tasks.

## Usage

```cmd
RunHidden <COMMAND>
```

>**Note**
>Don't forget to escape characters like `|`, `>`, `<` etc with `^` like that: `^|`.
